### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a private project (a mobile application made with react-native). Beside that, Iâ€™m also trying to sync (trying to stay updated) with native android development and also learning some basics of web information security.  

Let this learning journey of ours never end.
